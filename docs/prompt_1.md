You need to enter deep planning mode! I need you to conduct a deep dive level analysis on the third and fourth proof type.

You need to focus on the proofs after the governance proof (G0, G1, and G2). You need to exhaustively read these!

ALL proofs have supposedly been implemented, but I need deeply granular analysis of ALL our proofs After governance (Don't worry about chained proof and Governance proof in the lite client 2, those are well understood, tested, and confirmed perfect). For those proof systems after Governance, I also need to thoroughly understand files involved, and all proof artifacts produced. Deeply review the White paper and deeply review the ENTIRE shared folders of the validator and  contract code base. WE are using anchor contract v3. Deeply understand the Code base to identify in deeply, analyze the level of proof that occurs at a certain validator level for things like that the proof step after governance where we're looking at validator, no consensus, intent, validation, and carryover into the anchor to prove that the anchor successfully was made in carries over the cryptographic lineage from the very beginning of the chained proof.  Similarly, after that certen level validator cocnseuss and anchor proof, there is a fourth level proof that occurs on the target chain. This fourth level proof is her actions and activities that occur on the external gene for things like it carries over from the third level proof on the certain alligator side where it's looking at the anchor on the external chain validating it graphically along the lines, consensus that it passes all anchor requirements at the desired or specified transaction from the anchor is executed via the abstract account contract, and that the executed contract is properly verified as executed in those details are written back to Accumulate.
So your task is to find these two level proofs, and comprehensive, analyze them provide a deep level analysis on every aspect of how they work, what they prove, how they satisfy the white paper/s requirements, the artifacts they produce, what additional proof construction artifacts would be needed to independently reconstruct and verify the proof, files includes, etc. etc. and write this markdown report here: C:\Accumulate_Stuff\certen\proofs_service\docs
